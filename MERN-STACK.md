MERN Stack:

    1.MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster devlopment of full-stack web applications.

    2.MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js.

    3.Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work.


MERN Stack Components:
    
    1.MongoDB: 

        i.Fast – Being a document-oriented database, easy to index documents. Therefore a faster response.

        ii.Use of JavaScript – MongoDB uses JavaScript which is the biggest advantage.

        iii.Scalability – Large data can be handled by dividing it into several machines.
    
    2.Express:
        
        i.Asynchronous and Single-threaded.

        ii.Effecient, fast & scalable.

        iii.Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router.

    3.React:

        i.Virtual DOM - A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object.

        ii.High Performance – Features like Virtual DOM, JSX and Components makes it much faster than the rest of the frameworks out there.

        iii.Developing Android/Ios Apps – With React Native you can easily code Android-based or IOS-Based apps.
    
    4.Node.js:

        i.Open source JavaScript Runtime Environemnt

        ii.Single threading – Follows a single threaded model.

        iii.Data Streaming
